\section{Introduction}

Today, lithium-ion batteries have become a fundamental part of our daily lives, powering everything from smartphones to electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. As the demand for portable and sustainable devices continues to grow, the need to develop efficient and safe battery charging systems becomes increasingly critical.\\

However, charging batteries presents several challenges, including voltage and current management, which, if not properly controlled, can result in battery degradation, overheating, or even fire risks. Therefore, it is essential to have a system that not only efficiently charges batteries but also continuously monitors their condition.\\

This project aims to design a lithium-ion battery charging system that includes current and voltage control, ensuring a safe charging process and extending battery life. Through the development of this system, we hope to learn about the integration of electronic components, the importance of charge control, and best practices for circuit design.\\

Furthermore, the proposed system has practical applications in diverse areas, including mobile device charging stations, sustainable energy systems, and electric vehicles, underscoring the relevance of this project in a global context.
