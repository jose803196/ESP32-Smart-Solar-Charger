\section{Analysis} 

With theoretical calculations, verified by simulation, one can observe a good design (not excellent), but a good design. While it is true that there are already made and much better designs in the world, basic knowledge of electronic equipment design was applied here, from its conception to the last (PCB). In addition, it can be seen that in the schematic design, things had to be changed and added that are not contemplated in the calculations or simulation, such as an amplifier or a relay after the microcontroller. Aside from that, the PCB design does not have a 3D of said relay, only its footprint. As for the battery, only one battery was considered, that is, a single battery, which can make this inefficient, unless it has a single battery charging system.
