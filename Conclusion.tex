\section{Conclusion} 

Part of the objectives I proposed in the project statement were met. Furthermore, an entire project was designed from scratch, which is gaining relevance and may be somewhat complex due to lithium batteries and renewable energy. I also applied knowledge acquired throughout my degree, such as the use of AI, and what I learned in the coursework. It also helped me enter the world of schematics and PCBs, complex simulations in NGSPCICE (for the model of a solar panel and a microcontroller, since the latter doesn't have firmware).
